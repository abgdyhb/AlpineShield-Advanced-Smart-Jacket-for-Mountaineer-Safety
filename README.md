## 📖 Introduction
Mountaineering exposes climbers to extreme environments with risks such as **altitude sickness, hypothermia, frostbite, rapid weather changes, avalanches, and toxic gases**.  
In remote areas, lack of immediate medical assistance and reliable communication often leads to undetected fatalities.  

The **Alpine Shiels Project** offers a compact safety solution by integrating:
- Real-time health monitoring (heart rate, oxygen, body temperature, muscle activity)  
- Environmental tracking (temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, rainfall)  
- Wireless data transmission and GPS tracking  

This system ensures proactive decision-making, quick emergency response, and improved climber survival.
