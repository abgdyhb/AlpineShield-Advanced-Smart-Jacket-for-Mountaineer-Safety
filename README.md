## 📖 Introduction
Mountaineering exposes climbers to extreme environments with risks such as **altitude sickness, hypothermia, frostbite, rapid weather changes, avalanches, and toxic gases**.  
In remote areas, lack of immediate medical assistance and reliable communication often leads to undetected fatalities.  

The **Alpine Shiels Project** offers a compact safety solution by integrating:
- Real-time health monitoring (heart rate, oxygen, body temperature, muscle activity)  
- Environmental tracking (temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, rainfall)  
- Wireless data transmission and GPS tracking  

This system ensures proactive decision-making, quick emergency response, and improved climber survival.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Health Monitoring**: Enable mountaineers to track vital health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and muscle activity in real-time.  
- **Environmental Awareness**: Integrate sensors to monitor fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and rainfall.  
- **Connectivity & Safety**: Provide real-time GPS tracking and wireless communication using NRF modules for emergency assistance.  
- **Modular Design**: Deliver a **wearable jacket system** with detachable compartments for easy maintenance and organization of components.  
- **Decision Support**: Improve overall safety, performance, and decision-making by combining health and environmental data into a single, user-friendly platform.

## 📖 Result and Discussions

The microcontroller controls all the health monitoring
Sensors and sends the data to the caretaker through the
NRF module. A buzzer is there for an emergency signal
to send the signal to the caretaker in case if any health
emergency occurs.
The data monitored by the system includes the heart rate,
body and atmospheric temperature, pulse rate,
atmospheric and body pressure, and real time location of
the climber, ensuring a through tracking system. This
system is vital in extreme conditions where health and
location data need to be transmitted continuously for the
climber’s safety.
